# Neural-Network
A simple Neural Network, in Java, for recognizing handwritten digits.
This project includes 7 files. Five of them implement the neural network,
one is for testing and the last is a MnistReader class I provided
myself from jeffgriffith/mnist-reader. Thumbs up!

The accuracy of the network may reach 92% depending on many variables.
Yet, there is plenty room for improvement. Below there is an example of the 
network's score.

Epoch: 98                                      
9207 / 10000                                             

Epoch: 99                                       
9233 / 10000                                 

Epoch: 100                                       
9255 / 10000
